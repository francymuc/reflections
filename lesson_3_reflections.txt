When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
I prefer a remote repository when I want to share code with others, collaborate on code with others or just to backup data

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
I like to commit several changes first only locally and later share with others on the remote when it results in a working solution.
Or I have cloned a respository from someone else and only want to develop it further locally and not update the remote.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork is to clone from GitHub to GitHub.
Clone is to make a copy from a remote repository locally.
Branch is a path on a local repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
I can identify the changes made remotely and then merge info my development in a controlled way
